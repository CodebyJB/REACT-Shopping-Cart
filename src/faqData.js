    question: "How do you ship ice cream?",
    answer:
      "We ship our ice cream via Ground or 2Day Air service contingent on the shipping address. We pack our ice cream in an insulated box with enough dry ice to ensure that treats stay frozen for up to two days while in transit.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if I receive my order and the dry ice is gone?",
    answer:
      'Don\'t panic! As long as your ice cream is still "refrigerator-cold" to the touch, your pints can be safely stored in your freezer with no reduction in quality.',
  },
  {
    question: "How do I handle dry ice?",
    answer:
      "Ice cream shipments are packed with just enough dry ice to disappear before you open your package, but if you open your package to find pieces of dry ice still remaining, DO NOT TOUCH them. Leave the dry ice in the box, and put the box outside (or in a garage) so that the dry ice can naturally dissipate. Ensure that children or pets will not be able to access the box. Do not attempt to seal the dry ice off in a jar or container, as it may cause harm. Please carefully read the dry ice warning instructions, which are included in every package. We will not be held liable for any damage caused by improper handling of dry ice material.",

  {
    question:
      "What kind of packaging material do you use to ship ice cream? Is it recyclable?",
    answer:
      "We ship our ice cream using ClimaCell insulated box liners. ClimaCell is material made from renewable plant-based components and paper. It is fully curbside recyclable, making it the ideal replacement for unsustainable insulators like Styrofoam.",
